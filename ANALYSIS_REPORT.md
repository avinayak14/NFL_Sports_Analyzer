## Detailed Roster Analysis

### Running Back Dilemma
The model identifies a surprising hierarchy for your RB/FLEX spots:

1.  **T. Henderson (New England)**: **0.093 Score**.
    *   *Reasoning*: Currently shows better efficiency per touch than McCaffrey in recent weeks, combined with a neutral matchup vs NYJ.
2.  **Christian McCaffrey (San Francisco)**: **0.032 Score**.
    *   *Reasoning*: While a superstar, his *efficiency* (EPA/play) has been average recently. He is still a safe start due to volume, but the model flags Henderson as the "hot hand".
3.  **Tyrone Tracy (Giants)**: **-0.040 Score**.
    *   *Reasoning*: Negative EPA indicates inefficient touches. Tougher spot vs Las Vegas.
4.  **Ashton Jeanty (Raiders)**: **-0.127 Score**.
    *   *Reasoning*: **STRONGLY SIT**. Extremely poor recent efficiency (-0.268 EPA). Despite a "good" matchup on paper vs NYG, his performance does not warrant a championship start.

### Optimal Lineup Construction
*   **QB**: B. Purdy
*   **RB1**: T. Henderson
*   **RB2**: C. McCaffrey
*   **WR1**: J. Smith-Njigba
*   **WR2**: C. Olave
*   **TE**: T. McBride
*   **FLEX**: (Check Waivers or Bench) -- *Jeanty/Tracy are risky options.*

> [!TIP]
> **Key Insight**: Do not be fooled by Ashton Jeanty's name value or the "implied" favorable matchup. The metrics show he is currently detrimental to fantasy scoring probability relative to your other options.
